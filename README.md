# Next.js 15 Unexpected Error with Comments in JSX

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15 where a seemingly innocuous comment within JSX can lead to an unexpected error. The error is particularly noticeable when strict mode is enabled.

## The Problem
A simple comment inside a JSX expression can cause Next.js 15 to throw an error during rendering, making it difficult to debug.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

Navigate to `/about` to see the error.

## Solution
The solution is to remove the comments from the JSX. While the comments themselves may seem harmless, they unexpectedly interfere with the strict rendering behavior of Next.js 15.

This issue highlights the importance of writing clean and concise code to avoid such unexpected behavior in Next.js.
